pearOS Sonoma ISO and how to install as it's missing from GRUB

Fist off, you're gonna need an ISO, which may actually be the only reason you're here, to run it in a virtual machine, or to just test it in live, anyways, here's a link to a google drive where the ISO is, just note that it may not be always the latest ISO, but it should be updated frequently enough, anyways, here: https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1v7U687glTEzgjOVUWQAyoiPhHj0cjZLg&export=download&authuser=0&confirm=t&uuid=2e8f1c5c-a00a-466a-86be-f40a39069c29&at=APZUnTWrDFKrvN5VisZEwORng2H2%3A1711340396351

Now, download balenaEtcher: etcher.balena.io

Now, to the requirements to be able to do this are: having a dual-boot, now right now i won't go into the depths of making a dual-boot because there are a bunch of tutorials online you can search for yourself, and if you're wanting to install this OS you have to know that it is an alpha and will be buggy and i seriosly recommend you do not use it until it is stable, and if you want this OS then you have experimented with Linux and have a backup plan and will not store anything important in it, you need a Linux OS, can be just one OS but you will dual-boot with pearOS Sonoma, if you have those requirements then continue, if you do not have a Linux OS then search your distro of choice and search how to install it
